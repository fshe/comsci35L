<br>  abstract={This short paper explores an implementation of a new 
technology called 3D die stacking and describes research activity at 
Intel. 3D die stacking is the bonding of two die either face-to-face or 
face-to-back in order to construct the 3D structure. In this work, a 
face-to-face bonding is utilized because it yields a higher density 
die-to-die inter-connect than is possible with face-to-back. With 
sufficiently dense die-to-die interconnect devices as complex as an iA32
 microprocessor can be repartitioned or split between two die in order 
to simultaneously improve performance and power. The 3D structure of 
this emerging technology is examined and applied in this paper to a real
 x86 deeply pipelined high performance microprocessor. In this initial 
study, it is shown that a 3D implementation can potentially improve the 
performance by 15% while improving power by 15%.},
