abstract={This short paper explores an implementation of a new technology called 3D die stacking and describes research activity at Intel. 3D die stacking is the bonding of two die either face-to-face or face-to-back in order to construct the 3D structure. In this work, a face-to-face bonding is utilized because it yields a higher density die-to-die inter-connect than is possible with face-to-back. With sufficiently dense die-to-die interconnect devices as complex as an iA32 microprocessor can be repartitioned or split between two die in order to simultaneously improve performance and power. The 3D structure of this emerging technology is examined and applied in this paper to a real x86 deeply pipelined high performance microprocessor. In this initial study, it is shown that a 3D implementation can potentially improve the performance by 15% while improving power by 15%.},

abstract={A simple observation, made over 30 years ago, on the growth in the number of devices per silicon die has become the central driving force of one of the most dynamic of the world's industries. Because of the accuracy with which Moore's Law has predicted past growth in IC complexity, it is viewed as a reliable method of calculating future trends as well, setting the pace of innovation, and defining the rules and the very nature of competition. And since the semiconductor portion of electronic consumer products keeps growing by leaps and bounds, the Law has aroused in users and consumers an expectation of a continuous stream of faster, better, and cheaper high-technology products. Even the policy implications of Moore's Law are significant: it is used as the baseline assumption in the industry's strategic road map for the next decade and a half},

title={Leakage current: Moore's law meets static power},
year={2003},
volume={36},
number={12},
pages={68-75},
abstract={Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off. The other source of power dissipation in today's microprocessors, dynamic power, arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today's chips. Until recently, only dynamic power has been a significant source of power consumption, and Moore's law helped control it. However, power consumption has now become a primary microprocessor design constraint; one that researchers in both industry and academia will struggle to overcome in the next few years. Microprocessor design has traditionally focused on dynamic power consumption as a limiting factor in system integration. As feature sizes shrink below 0.1 micron, static power is posing new low-power design challenges.},
