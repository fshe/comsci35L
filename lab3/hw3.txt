1)
"case_long_iso_time_style:" was changed into  "case long_iso_time_style:",
because "case_long_iso_time_style:" is considered a label, and is never
accessed. because of the break statement preceding it, this label is never
reached. These problems are fixed by changing "case_long_iso_time_style:" to
"case long_iso_time_style:".

2)
A potential problem is the format Y-M-D, with which the month and day are
numbers and could be confused in countries where Y-D-M is used instead,
whereas writing out the name of the month cannot be confused.

3)
When the script is invoked on /dev/null, python raises and IndexError if the
sequence that random.choice is choosing from is empty.

4)
python 3 gives an invalid syntax error on the line "except IOError as (errno,
strerror)", as IOError cannot be renamed as errno and strerror.
